### Binary Tree Algorithms
This repository implements Binary Tree Algorithms, which are among the most important data structures in Computer Science. It also shows how to use these algorithms to manipulate binary trees for problem-solving.
Covered topics include:
- Creating binary trees and traversing them using DFS and BFS algorithms.
- Finding a target element in a binary tree.
- Finding the minimum value in a binary tree.
- Calculating the sum of values in a binary tree.
- Determining the maximum path sum in a binary tree.
